<p>When thinking about designing and developing a project, defining a <strong>goal or set of goals</strong> is very important to do and something you want to get right early on. This definition of 'right' varies from person to person and team to team, but for me it boils down to what we shall call the <strong>Project's Pillars</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Project-Pillars">Project Pillars<a class="anchor-link" href="#Project-Pillars"> </a></h2><ul>
<li><strong>Why</strong> am I building this project and why does it matter?</li>
<li><strong>Who</strong> am I building this project for and would they care?</li>
<li><strong>How</strong> will I build this project and how efficiently can this be done?</li>
<li><strong>Where</strong> will this project be used; is it a physical space, a website e.t.c.?</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> will be gained from having built this project once complete?</li>
<li><strong>When</strong> will this project be complete?</li>
</ul>
<p>It's clear that our Project Pillars a largely questions that we must answer. How we answer them is equally as important as having them. We do this by first defining a <strong>Project Statement</strong>; a short phrase/sentence that describes the author's motivations for attending to the project. Having this will help clarify and rank order our <strong>Project Pillars</strong> into our <strong>Project Criteria</strong>.</p>
<p>Actually getting these right is another thing and process entirely, but having them earmarked in good time definitely puts you on the right path. To better ground this post in reality, I'll use the example of a project I was working on while writing this post (<a href="{% post_url 2020-05-17-background-segmentation %}">blog</a>). In that project (<code>Using Object Segmentation for Image Background Subtraction</code>), I was inspired into action by a problem I found a interesting and effectively surmountable; <code>How could I stylize a personal photo with varied effects</code>. Given this problem, how would you then construct your project statement?</p>
<p>Well ...</p>

<p>A project statement must be clear, concise and critical and so it would be crucial that your project title reflect this before it could serve as a project statement. The distinction between project title and statement is necessary since a title can sometimes encompass more scope than can/should be captured by your statement e.g. when the end goal is not well defined such as in exploratory work.</p>
<p>The great thing about a project statement is that it can quickly and effectively resolve your project goals while pointing out a project's gaps and shortcomings too. This latter point is rather important because your trail of recorded thought can then be reviewed and interrogated by others who may come upon your work. If you have scientific training of any sort, you might recognize the project statement's basis in the <strong>Scientific Hypothesis</strong>!; a cornerstone of modern epistemology where we predetermine our goal of exploration. However, that's a far as the similarities go because a Hypothesis exercises a lot more foundational robustness e.g. <em>Theory of Falsifiability</em>.</p>
<h2 id="Project-Criteria">Project Criteria<a class="anchor-link" href="#Project-Criteria"> </a></h2><p>Resolving our project goals involves descriptively analysing our project statement to better itemise and rank our pillars, the output of which will be our <strong>Project Criteria</strong> table. Having this can be especially powerful because it allows us to prioritise our work towards meeting both our user requirements and developer bandwidth. If you have worked on a team or client-facing project, I am sure you can relate to scoping issues and overruns arising midway through a project. This can be a gut-wrenching process where you'll need as much project navigational tooling as you have available to recover/salvage the situation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Using Object Segmentation for Image Background Subtraction.</p>

<p>Given my project title above, we can see that it meets our 3 C's (clear, concise and critical). This means we can go ahead and use it as our project statement. Below are the project pillars ranked and refined into our project criteria.</p>

<p>The above table representation of our project pillars grounds our project planning to meet both our user requirements (who + why + where) and our developer bandwidth (what + when + how). Amusingly, I like to think of the latter as the developer's <strong>space-time-travel problem</strong>. By now, the value in doing this should be somewhat evident; as developers, every endeavour you undertake should be considered a marathon. While we <strong>can</strong> sprint every so often, we should realize that much of our work should live past our active participation; it's posterity stands a better chance of outliving ours.</p>

<h2 id="Project-Board">Project Board<a class="anchor-link" href="#Project-Board"> </a></h2><p>With our project statement and criteria, we can now go about creating a <strong>Project Board</strong>. This can take many forms, but in its essence its a visual breakdown of our tasks in a way that is accessible, manipulable and efficient. For my purposes, I typically use a <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards">Kanban board</a> which is a foundation element of the Kanban visual management method developed by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka in the “New New Product Development Game.”</p>
<p>Just as there are numerous ways one can visualize a project board, there are equally as many tools to implement Kanban boards. You could go with a simple whiteboard with post-its and markers. As a technology worker you could alternatively use a software tool like the novice-friendly <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> or the expert-tooled <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>. While I do have experience with both, my new kanban tool of choice is now Github's <a href="https://github.com/features/project-management">Projects</a>. It's simplicity, ease of use and extensibility make it welcoming to project management up-starts and empowering for experienced old-hats. Below is the Github Project board I created for the subject project.</p>

<p>The above is only a visual representation; I could very well go with a list-based version as shown below and update it as needed. My recommendation is to go with what works best for you; that should be a function of what you are comfortable with and, again, your project criteria.</p>

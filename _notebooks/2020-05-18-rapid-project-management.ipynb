    "The above can be achieved in a myriad of ways for an equally varied number of project scales. If you have heard of **agile software development**, you will recognize that it too is a methodology designed to both formulate, achieve and improve upon SMART goals through enhanced team communication and practices. There is however a particular gap in how well agile workflows such as [scrum](https://www.scrumguides.org/index.html) adapt to small project scales, both in team size and project scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Small project scales go by many names; *pet-project*, *side-project*, *hackathon project*, *school project*, *proof of concept*, *side-hustle* e.t.c.. For every one of these that I've undertaken in the past 7 years, one thing that I've consistently wondered is how to best maximise their **utility**, which much like the often used word **impact** can be rather dubious to decipher. While the spirit of the two words seemingly overlap, they do have one distinctive difference. This is that the word utility has a storied and entrenched history of examination rooted in philosophy whereas impact remains a largely subjective metric with varied connotations depending on the context of its use. Suffice it to say, grounding a framework on a rigorously tested and widely accepted metric such as utility can and generally should confer confidence when evaluating the results of a subjected measurand. For example, I would feel very confident in the results obtained from using a centimeter-scale ruler to measure the length of my forearm vs a drinking glass. In the case of the glass, I would have to worry about which type of drinking glass and which of its dimensions to use to measure my forearm. The same cannot be said for the ruler because its units are consistent and use agreed upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rapid project management workflow is a proposal for a small-scale project framework based on a defintion of utility described by [Jeremy Bentham (1748 - 1832)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham):\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Utility** is that property in any object which tends to produce benefit, advantage, good or happiness\n",
    "\n",
    "The above definition of utility is further refined by the Bentham's **Utility Principle** below\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The utility principle** is that which approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever, according to the tendency which it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question\n",
    "\n",
    "These definitions may come across as abvious to some and possibly superfluous to others. However, having them precisely codified in this way provides a solid foundation upon which to build. A philosophical exploration of utility will be reserved for future work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the goal of the Rapid Project Management Workflow is to provide a safety net for small project scale endeavours by enhancing their longevity/posterity. In RPM, we define enhancing posterity as maximising the projects benefit to the most number of people **for the longest period of time**."

If you have scientific training of any sort, you might recognize the project statement's basis in the **Scientific Hypothesis**!; a cornerstone of modern epistemology where we predetermine our goal of exploration.

While I do have experience with both, my new kanban tool of choice is now Github's [Projects](https://github.com/features/project-management).

    "\n",
    "We have covered the rapid project management framework and applied it to the project [Object Segmentation for Background Subtraction]({% post_url 2020-05-17-background-segmentation %}). Through this we have introduced the following concepts:\n",
    "- **Project Pillars** : A set of 5 questions that serve to center the project author's immediate concerns\n",
    "- **Project Statement** : A short phrase/sentence that describes the author's motivations for attending to the project and abides by the 3 C's (Clarity, Conciseness, Criticality)\n",
    "- **Project Criteria** - A table detailing a description and rank-order of the project pillar\n",
    "- **Project Board** - A visual breakdown of a developers tasks that is accessible, manipulable and efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the ethos of the RPM workflow is to promote an early delineation of project tasks for effective execution through accountability. The value in doing so is well established in project management literature. However, while established workflows for medium to large projects and teams exist, the same cannot be said for small variants of the same. The RPM workflow is a living proposal to better serve the needs of smaller project demographics/spectrums."
